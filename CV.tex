\section{Selected Research Projects}
\cventry{Aug. 2017 - Present}{Mantis}{``A fast, small, and exact large-scale sequence-search index''}{Computational Biology Lab., SBU, UMD}
{\newline{} \url{https://github.com/splatlab/mantis/tree/mergeMSTs}}{Mantis is a space and time efficient data structure to index and query large collections of raw sequencing read experiments.
The index is based on colored de Bruijn graph representation and therefore supports graph-based operations such as graph traversal, and bubble calling useful for assembly and variation detection. In our recent work we have advanced the index to more than 30,000 raw read sequencing samples and enabled the nice feature of gradual growth by making the index incrementally updatable.}
\cventry{Jun. 2017 - Aug. 2020}{Pufferfish and Puffaligner}{``A space and time-efficient compacted de Bruijn graph index and aligner''}{Computational Biology Lab., SBU, UMD}
{\newline{} \url{https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pufferfish/tree/develop}}{Pufferfish is an efficient data structure for indexing colored compacted de Bruijn graphs. This index achieves a balance between time and space resources by making use of succinct data structures and minimum perfect hash function. PuffAligner, our recent work, is a highly sensitive aligner on top of Pufferfish for aligning different types of short sequencing reads to a huge population of references, specifically good in the representation of high similarity in the reference sequences.}
\cventry{Apr. - Jun. 2017}{Rainbowfish}{``A succinct colored de Bruijn graph data structure''}{Computational Biology Lab., SBU}{\newline{} \url{https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/rainbowfish}}{This tool provides a new data structure to store and query colored de Bruijn graphs that in case of large data sets improves storage by more than twenty times compared to state-of-the-art tools without hurting performance of the queries.}
\cventry{Nov. 2016 - Apr. 2018}{Grouper}{An extension to ``Rapid Clustering'' tool}{Computational Biology Lab., SBU}{\newline{} \url{https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/grouper}}{Grouper is a tool for clustering contigs of a de novo transcriptome assembly. We improved the accuracy of clustering by making use of orphan reads, for which each end of the pair is mapped to a different reference sequence.}
\cventry{Aug 2016-Jan 2017}{MLDD}{``Multi-Level Distribution Detection''}{Data Science Lab., SBU}{}{Using statistical tests and classification models such as NaiveBayes we show how distribution of NLP features in social media changes in different levels of analysis (county, user, and message). This can highly affect prior assumptions for further text analysis as we show that central-limit theorem could be applied in social media language analysis as well.}
\cventry{2013-2014}{AutismFD}{``A game to improve face emotion detection in children with Autism''}{}{}{Beside collaboration with psychology students to design the method, I also implemented the idea as a tool in C\# language. This package was used in a treatment center to help children with Autism to identify face emotions and track their progress over time.}
%\cventry{2012-2013}{PersonalityMatcher}{``Improve students’ educational condition via detecting best friendship communities'' project}{IUST}{\newline{}Under the supervision of Professors Jahed \& Mozayani}{We designed and developed a multi-agent system in Netlogo environment based on NEO personality questionnaire.}

.\newline{}%
During the project, we worked on analyzing and forecasting social media user’s psychological state based on their language in their posts using statistical methods such as significance tests and time series models such as ARMA and ARIMA.}
\cventry{Jan-Aug 2015}{Senior Designer and Developer}{\httplink[Nexeven AB]{http://www.nexeven.com/}}{Tehran, Iran}{}{Nexeven AB is a Swedish company and a niche player in the online video broadcasting field.}
\cventry{2011-2015}{Team Supervisor, Senior Designer and Developer}{Tosan Intelligent Data Miners Co. (\httplink[TIDM]{http://www.tosanidm.ir/})}{Data Mining Development Team}{Tehran, Iran}{TIDM is the first solution provider for fraud detection and anti-money laundry in banking section in Iran, a Subsidiary of Tosan Company.
%\newline{}%
\begin{itemize}%
\item \textbf{Customer Relationship Management System} [2014] \\
In this project we use statistical and data mining methods to calculate customer`s RFM, CLV, and churn probability.
\item \textbf{Data mining Module, Operational Intelligence System} [2014] \\
This module, developed in PLSQL, uses Statistical and Mining Methods such as regression models, error functions, k-means, and SVM to detect fraudulent transactions online in the stream of transactions.
\item \textbf{Customer Name Similarity Detection Module} [2013] \\
As a part of Anti-money Laundry System, this module uses natural language algorithms to detect accounts with similar names. The whole system is developed in PLSQL and now operational in many private banks in Iran including \httplink[Eghtesad-Novin]{http://english.enbank.ir/} and Ansar Bank.
\item \textbf{Unsupervised Fraud Detection System, Version 1 \& 2} [2011-2014] \\
Version 1 which is fully designed and developed by myself is now operational in \httplink[Saman]{http://sb24.ir/En/Business/index.html} Bank, \httplink[Ansar]{http://www.ansarbank.com/EnHome.aspx} Bank, and \httplink[Mehr-e-Eghtesad]{http://www.mebank.ir/} Bank in Iran. Version 2 is now installed in \httplink[Eghtesad-Novin]{http://english.enbank.ir/} Bank.
